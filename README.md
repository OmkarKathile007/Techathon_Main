# FOOD PLATFORM
SurplusShift is a real-time platform designed to connect surplus food donors with local NGOs and volunteers. The primary goal is to reduce food waste, fight hunger, and build sustainable communities by streamlining the donation process. SurplusShift leverages modern web alongside deep learning for image classification and IBM Watson Assistant for conversational support.

Through an intuitive interface, donors can upload surplus food details (including images), which are automatically classified to ensure accurate categorization. NGOs and volunteers can then claim, schedule pickups, and track donations in real time — reducing manual overhead and maximizing efficiency.
